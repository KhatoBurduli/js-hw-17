      <p>
        "Coraline" is a dark fantasy animated film based on Neil Gaiman's
        novella. The story follows Coraline Jones, an adventurous young girl who
        moves into a new home with her neglectful parents. Seeking excitement,
        Coraline discovers a hidden door that leads to an alternate version of
        her life, seemingly perfect but controlled by an Other Mother with
        buttons for eyes. As Coraline navigates this eerie parallel world, she
        uncovers its sinister secrets and must find the courage to save herself
        and her real parents from the Other Mother's grasp.
